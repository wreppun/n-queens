# N-Queens

Goals:

1. implement the algorithm from wikipedia
2. implement a DFS algorithm for NxN using Lists
3. add in flipped + rotated checks

Did not:

- implement a basic DFS algorithm for NxN, maybe using pairs
- implement a faster DFS algorithm using arrays

Possible optimizations:

1. Use arrays instead of lists
