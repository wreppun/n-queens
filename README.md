# N-Queens

Goals:

1. implement the algorithm from wikipedia
x. implement a basic DFS algorithm for NxN, maybe using pairs
x. implement a faster DFS algorithm using arrays
2. implement a dfs algorithm using Lists
4. add in flipped + rotated checks

Possible optimizations:

1. Use arrays instead of lists
